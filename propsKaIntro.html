<!-- props allow us to write configurable components. Props are like arguments that we can provide to our components.
 props allow use to pass arguments and those values are used in the components-->
 <!-- when you want use multiple props, you just give commas in the arguments of the function component (during the destructured approach ) and 
while rendering the component, just write the second prop without commo just like your give attributes for html -->

<!-- 
    we can give default values to props while using the destructing the object method like
    export default function Greeter({person="everyone"})
    so when we dont pass any value while rendering in the app.js then everyone is taken by default
